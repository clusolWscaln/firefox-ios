## Step 1: Download and install Forsk Atoll v3.4.0.15114 x64
 
You can download the setup file of Forsk Atoll v3.4.0.15114 x64 from the official website of Forsk or from any other trusted source. Run the setup file and follow the instructions to install Atoll on your computer. You will need a license key to activate Atoll, which you can request from Forsk or from your vendor.
 
## Step 2: Download and install Sentinel SuperPro/UltraPro dongle emulator
 
A Sentinel SuperPro/UltraPro dongle is a hardware device that contains a license key for Atoll. It is plugged into a USB port of your computer and allows you to run Atoll without any restrictions. However, dongles can be lost, stolen, or damaged, which can prevent you from using Atoll.
 
A dongle emulator is a software program that mimics the function of a dongle and creates a virtual dongle on your computer. You can use a dongle emulator to bypass the need for a physical dongle and run Atoll without any problems.
 
You can download a Sentinel SuperPro/UltraPro dongle emulator from Brain Studio[^2^] or from any other reliable source. Run the emulator program and follow the instructions to install it on your computer.
 
## Step 3: Create a dump file of your dongle
 
A dump file is a copy of the data stored in your dongle. You will need a dump file to create a virtual dongle on your computer using the emulator program.
 
To create a dump file of your dongle, you will need to connect your dongle to your computer and run a dumper program that can read the data from your dongle and save it as a file on your computer.
 
You can download a dumper program from Brain Studio[^2^] or from any other trustworthy source. Run the dumper program and select your dongle type (Sentinel SuperPro/UltraPro) and your USB port where your dongle is connected. Click on "Read" to start the dumping process. Wait until the process is completed and save the dump file on your computer.
 
## Step 4: Create a virtual dongle using the emulator program
 
Now that you have a dump file of your dongle, you can use it to create a virtual dongle on your computer using the emulator program.
 
Run the emulator program and click on "Load Dump" to load the dump file that you created in the previous step. The emulator program will analyze the dump file and create a virtual dongle on your computer that contains the same license key as your physical dongle.
 
## Step 5: Run Atoll with the virtual dongle
 
You are now ready to run Atoll with the virtual dongle on your computer. You do not need to plug in your physical dongle anymore.
 
Run Atoll and enter the license key that is stored in your virtual dongle. You should be able to use all the modules of Atoll without any limitations.
